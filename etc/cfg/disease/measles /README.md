================

People and groups at risk of measles complications:

Measles can be serious in all age groups. However, there are several groups that are more likely to suffer from measles complications:

- Children younger than 5 years of age
- Adults older than 20 years of age
- Pregnant women
- People with compromised immune systems, such as from leukemia or HIV infection


Death. Nearly 1 to 3 of every 1,000 children who become infected with measles will die from respiratory and neurologic complications.

Common complications include ear infections, diarrhoea, and pneumonia. In New Zealand, more than 15 measles cases out of 100 (15%) are hospitalised. Pneumonia accounts for nearly two thirds of measles deaths. Approximately 1 in 1000 cases develop encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), of these 15% die and approximately one third are left with permanent brain damage.

Several years after infection, 1 in 100,000 measles cases will develop subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), a degenerative brain disease; this condition is always fatal.

Measles is one of the most contagious diseases
Measles is so contagious that if one person has it, up to 90% of the people close to that person who are not immune will also become infected.

Infected people can spread measles to others from four days before through four days after the rash appears.

Measles virus can live for up to two hours in an airspace after an infected person leaves an area.

## Measles Symptom Prevalence (for people who are infected) by Age Group

| Age Group            | Asymptomatic     | Mild              | Hospitalization   | ICU               | Fatality          |
|----------------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Children (0-5 years)  | High percentage  | High percentage   | 15%               | 3%                | 0.1-0.3%          |
| Adolescents (6-18 years)| Moderate percentage | Moderate percentage | Moderate percentage | Low percentage | Low percentage |
| Adults (19 years and older)| Low percentage | Low percentage | Low percentage | Very low percentage | Very low percentage |



Up to 30 percent of people with measles will develop complications â€“ usually children under 5 years old and adults over the age of 20.


According to historical data and estimates, the fatality rate for infants less than 1 year old who contract measles can range from 0.5% to 3%. This means that between 5 and 30 out of every 1,000 infants with measles in this age group may die from the infection.
