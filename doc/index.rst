Welcome to JUNE-NZ
===================================

**JUNE-NZ** is a collobrative Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) framework that has been adapted from the world-leading **JUNE** model 
led by Durham University (UK), which focuses on public health and epidemiology simulations. This collaborative framework incorporates cutting-edge AI technologies 
to facilitate dynamic simulations and analyses of complex systems in the context of New Zealand.

By leveraging **JUNE-NZ**, researchers and policymakers can gain valuable insights into various aspects of healthcare, 
enabling informed decision-making and effective planning strategies.

**JUNE-NZ** is an ongoing project funded by Inisitute of Environmental Science and Research (ESR), New Zealand.
