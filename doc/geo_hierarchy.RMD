The geographic hierarchy for New Zealand is defined [here](https://www.stats.govt.nz/methods/geographic-hierarchy/).
In *JUNE_NZ*, three stasticial geographic areas are used:

- Regional council
- Statistical Area 1 (Small Area)
- Statistical Area 2 (Smaller Area)

In order to get the geographic hierarchy data, we need to collect the following data:

- The hierarchy table: [link](https://datafinder.stats.govt.nz/table/106721-geographic-areas-table-2022/)
    - Regional council code: `REGC2022`
    - Statistical Area 1: `SA12022_code`
    - Statistical Area 2: `SA22022_code`
